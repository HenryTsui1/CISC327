# Assignment 3

## Template
The template for testing was changed slightly to keep things in line with the requirements laid out in the project description. There are 5 test case files that test the requirement R1, R2, R3, R7 and R8. As these are mainly front end tests, an additional test case was made to ensure the backend was functioning properly.

| R2.7.2            |  User name has to be   non-empty, alphanumeric-only, and space  allowed only if it is not the first   or the last character. -  Negative (empty username) | This failed because the library implemented in the CISC327  course for this project does not allow the user to make a  submission if a   field is empty. This stopped "Name format  error" from appearing because testing never left the /register page.  | This was solved by checking for the negative of a condition,  instead of the positive. The condition was "Log In" text is not  visible after clicking the register button, and that the text for all the  other errors was also not visible.  |

## Backend Test
The backend test uses the black-box technique for testing in three steps. Step 1: Create a new user, and give them a balance of 5000.  This is all recorded in the database.
Step 2:Login as the newly created user. Step 3: Verify that the profile page displays 5000 as the current user balance.
The html page pulls its information to populate name and balance based on that user's login info, so the database must have 5000 entered for that specific user.
