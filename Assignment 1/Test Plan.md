# Test Plan
## How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases (e.g. where did you store the test case markdown file for each team member).
The test case markdown files are stored on the Team's github in the Assignment 1 folder. A markdown file was made for each requirement (R1-R8). Each team member was randomly assigned two requirements and submitted them first in the test case branch of the git. A pull request was then made for another team member to look over the files before merging them to the master git.

## Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.



## How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)
We are planning on organizing the different test case code files into different folders per specification.
