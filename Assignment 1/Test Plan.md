# Test Plan
## How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases (e.g. where did you store the test case markdown file for each team member).
The test case markdown files are stored on the Team's github in the Assignment 1 folder. A markdown file was made for each requirement (R1-R8). Each team member was randomly assigned two requirements and submitted them first in the test case branch of the git. A pull request was then made for another team member to look over the files before merging them to the master git.

## Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.

We have decided to use the scrum model, and we'll host meetings and discuss our test cases and modify them.


The testing framework will be used to test each requirement individually, ensuring that each test only isolates one condition and can be used to find specific issues easily.

## How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)
Our test case code files will all be kept a folder called Test-Cases. Inside this folder will be eight folders, each corresponding to a single group of requirements. Within these folders, the natural language test cases as well as the actual testing code will be kept. If needed, there can be subfolders within these requirements folders, based on the parameters needed and the nature of those requirements. A single folder can be allocated per test case if needed.
